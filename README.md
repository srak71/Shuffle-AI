# I. Background & Biological Processes

            Music is a part of our lives daily. Our goal is to develop a method- using artificial 
        intelligence, data analytics, and training models- in which we are able to track 
        individual listening habits, correlate moods associated with certain types or genres of music,
        and create an optimal playlist, filled with either songs or low volume ambient-type music, 
        which corresponds to that individual’s mood. In this manner, we hope to increase user 
        listening time by increasing the individual’s ‘connectedness’ with the music and 
        enticing them to listen to more and more songs. 
        
 ## A) Auditory Stimulation
 
            Our stimulus, sound, propagates through space by compressing and expanding air molecules,
        sending them outwards from the source in all directions in the form of a pressure wave. 
        This pressure wave is perceived by the auditory system as a sound wave, and can be broken 
        down into two functioning variables: loudness and pitch.
        
            Volume can be determined from the amplitude of the stimuli sound wave, or how much change
            in Y occurs given a range X (wavelength), while pitch is derived to be the frequency of the 
            sound wave, or the length of X to complete one cycle (or wavelength). Pitch is measured in 
            Hertz (Hz), and limitations in the human auditory system allows us to perceive sounds in 
            the 1000-5000 Hz range with relatively greater sensitivity (other animals’ auditory systems 
            may have different restrictions or sensitivity ranges, thus some animals may have much greater 
            hearing and easily can perceive sounds humans cannot). We can hear this range at a greater 
            frequency due to the structure of the pinna (outer ear), which is shaped to amplify this 
            1000-5000Hz range and muffle sounds outside.
        
## B) Anatomy of the Ear

        Past the pinna, we reach the middle ear, consisting of three small bones (ossicles), 
        called the malleus (hammer), incus (anvil), and stapes (stirrup). The ossicles act as 
        an amplifier to small mechanical vibrations of air molecules, and sensitivity of the ossicles 
        can be changed by contracting muscles in the ear to filter out unwanted sounds (for instance, 
        contracting when loud noise prevents damage). 
        
        Further down in the ear, we reach the cochlea, made up of a coil of three parallel canals- 
        the vestibular canal, middle canal, and tympanic canal- all which branch to the vestibulocochlear
        nerve (VIII). Sound vibrations of the oval window cause a wave to pass through the vestibular canal, 
        and travel back down the tympanic canal. At the base of the tympanic canal lies a small moveable 
        membrane (the basilar membrane) , which allows the movement of non-compressible fluid within
        the canal. This basilar membrane is approximately 5 times wider at the apex than at the base
        (even though the cochlea grows narrower towards the apex), thus higher frequencies cause maximum
        displacement of fluid near the base, while lower frequencies cause the greatest displacement 
        at the apex. The cochlea then works to translate this temporal signal in the basilar membrane
        into a spatial signal.
